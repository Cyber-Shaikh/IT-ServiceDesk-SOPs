# Escalation Process – Core IT SOP

## Objective
To ensure timely resolution of incidents by escalating issues to appropriate resolver teams when they cannot be resolved within defined timelines or support scope.

## Scope
Applicable to all IT incidents managed by the Service Desk in an enterprise environment.

## Escalation Definition
Escalation is the process of transferring an incident to a higher level of support or management to prevent SLA breach or resolve complex issues.

## Types of Escalation

### 1. Functional Escalation
Escalation to a specialized or higher-level technical team when the issue requires advanced expertise.

**Examples:**
- Complex application failures
- Network or infrastructure issues
- Endpoint issues requiring re-imaging or hardware replacement

### 2. Hierarchical Escalation
Escalation to management or leadership when business impact is high or SLA risk exists.

**Examples:**
- Priority 1 incidents
- Repeated SLA breaches
- Customer dissatisfaction or business-critical impact

## Escalation Triggers
- Incident not resolved within defined SLA timelines
- Issue outside current support scope
- Repeated occurrence of the same issue
- High business impact or critical user groups affected

## Escalation Process
1. Identify need for escalation based on impact, urgency, or complexity
2. Gather all troubleshooting details and findings
3. Assign incident to the appropriate resolver group or manager
4. Communicate escalation details clearly in the ITSM tool
5. Continue monitoring and maintain ownership until resolution

## Communication During Escalation
- Provide regular updates to users and stakeholders
- Inform management in case of high-impact incidents
- Document all communications in the ITSM tool

## Outcome
Ensure incidents are escalated efficiently, resolved within SLA commitments, and handled with clear ownership and communication.
