# SLA & Priority Matrix – Core IT SOP

## Objective
To define incident priority levels based on business impact and urgency, ensuring timely resolution and adherence to service level agreements (SLAs).

## Scope
Applicable to all IT incidents handled by the Service Desk and resolver teams in an enterprise environment.

## Priority Definition
Incident priority is determined by a combination of:
- Business Impact (number of users or services affected)
- Urgency (how quickly the issue must be resolved)

## Priority Levels

### Priority 1 (Critical)
**Description:** Complete service outage or critical business impact  
**Impact:** Multiple users or business-critical systems affected  
**Target Response Time:** Immediate  
**Target Resolution Time:** As per agreed SLA (e.g., 4 hours)

**Examples:**
- Email or network outage
- Critical application unavailable
- Security-related access issues affecting multiple users

---

### Priority 2 (High)
**Description:** Major service degradation with significant impact  
**Impact:** Multiple users affected, workaround may exist  
**Target Response Time:** Within defined SLA  
**Target Resolution Time:** Same business day

**Examples:**
- Application performance issues
- VPN access problems for multiple users

---

### Priority 3 (Medium)
**Description:** Limited impact on business operations  
**Impact:** Single user or non-critical service affected  
**Target Response Time:** As per SLA  
**Target Resolution Time:** Within 1–2 business days

**Examples:**
- Individual user access issues
- Device-related problems with available workaround

---

### Priority 4 (Low)
**Description:** Minor issues or service requests  
**Impact:** Minimal business impact  
**Target Response Time:** As per SLA  
**Target Resolution Time:** Scheduled or best-effort

**Examples:**
- Password resets
- Software installation requests

## SLA Monitoring
- Track response and resolution times in the ITSM tool
- Escalate incidents approaching SLA breach
- Communicate delays proactively to users and stakeholders

## Outcome
Ensure consistent prioritization, SLA compliance, and efficient incident handling aligned with business needs.
