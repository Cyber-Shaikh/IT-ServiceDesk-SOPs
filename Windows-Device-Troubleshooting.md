# Windows Device Troubleshooting – Core IT SOP

## Objective
To diagnose and resolve common Windows device issues in an enterprise environment while minimizing user downtime.

## Scope
Applicable to Windows 10 and Windows 11 endpoint devices used by enterprise users.

## Common Issues
- Slow system performance
- Login failures or profile loading issues
- Application not responding
- Network connectivity problems
- Blue screen or unexpected restarts

## Initial Checks
1. Confirm device power and hardware status
2. Verify network connectivity (Wi-Fi / LAN)
3. Check available disk space and system resources
4. Validate user account and login status

## Troubleshooting Approach
1. Identify symptoms and recent changes
2. Review system error messages and logs
3. Restart required services or system if needed
4. Apply basic fixes (updates, driver checks, application repair)
5. Test system stability after resolution

## Escalation Criteria
- Repeated system crashes
- Hardware failure indicators
- OS corruption requiring re-imaging

## Outcome
Ensure the device is stable, secure, and ready for productive use. Document actions taken in the ITSM tool.
